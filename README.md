# Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm developed during the class of artificial intelligence.
The avaliation function chosen was the rastrigin function:

![rastringin function](https://github.com/rafaelviniciusoliveira/Particle-Swarm-Optimization/blob/main/Rastrigin_function.png)

The algorithm works based on these variables:
* size of the swarm
* cognitive component
* social component
* number of generations
* target value
