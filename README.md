# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithm developed during the class of artificial intelligence.
The avaliation function chosen was the rastrigin function:

![rastringin function](https://github.com/rafaelviniciusoliveira/Particle-Swarm-Optimization/blob/main/Rastrigin_function.png)

The algorithm works based on these variables:
* size of the population
* crossing rate
* elitism rate
* elitism (True or False)
* selection function (Roulette or Tournament)
* crossing function (One point or Multipoint)
* mutation rate
* number of generations
